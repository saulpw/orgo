<h3>prototype assembly</h3>

This is my current process for making a prototype.  Feel free to make your
own for personal or educational use, but I would appreciate a note if you do
anything with it.  

<ol>
<li>Create cardboard pieces for bonds and atoms, using 
<a href="carbondie.pdf">this die (PDF)</a>.  I stamp at least three 
sets from 1/8" cardboard.  

<li>Create <a href="orgo-board.pdf">the gameboard (PDF)</a>.  I just get
it printed on big paper at the print shop and spraymount it to big 
1/8" cardboard.

<li>Create double-sided cards from 1/16" cardboard.  Here's the 
<a href="orgo-front.pdf">front</a> and the <a href="orgo-back.pdf">back</a>.

<li>Find tokens to represent 1 unit and 5 units of currency.  I use
about $2 in pennies and nickels.

</ol>

<h3>The Board</h3>

The game board provides a place for almost all game components:

<ul>
<li>the Universal Bank: All bonds, atoms, and energy tokens are stored here
when not in play.  
<li>the Reaction Zone: all molecules and energy chits in play belong here.
<li>Thermometer: unused energy goes here, to indicate
 ambient temperature in the Reaction Zone.
<li>Molecule Cards: the shuffled pile of reactant and product cards goes here.
</ul>

In addition, each player is given a fire-diamond protection board, on which
he arranges an initial set of 20 protection chits.

<h4>Setup</h4>

<p>Shuffle the Molecule Cards and deal three to each player.  Place 
the rest on the board facedown.

<p>Place three 10-energy units on the Thermometer so to indicate
that the Temperature is 30 degrees.

<h3>Game Rules</h3>


<h4>Inviolable Laws</h4>
<ol>
<li><b>Conservation of Matter</b>: No atoms may be placed on or removed
from the board, except as explicitly described below.

<li><b>First Law [of Thermodynamics] (Conservation of Energy)</b>: Whenever a player moves a
bond, from the bank to the board or vice versa, the corresponding amount
of energy printed on the bond must be moved with it. 

<li><b>Second Law [of Thermodynamics] (Entropy as Heat)</b>:  If any excess energy remains on
the board at the end of a player's turn, that energy moves to the
temperature indicator, increasing the ambient temperature.
</ol>

<h4>Turn Structure</h4>

<p>On your turn, consult the Thermometer and roll the appropriate number of 
dice.  Add the dice and move that number of energy units from the 
Thermometer to the Reaction Zone. 

<p>So now you may:

<ol>
<li><b>Play a Reactant Card</b>.  Discard a Reactant
Card from your hand.  Take bonds and atoms from the bank
and replicate the molecule in the Reaction Zone.

<li><b>Play a Product Card</b>.  Place a Product Card from
your hand face up in front of you.  Then claim one molecule
on the board.  No one else may break any bonds in this molecule
though they can form new bonds with incomplete atoms.

<li><b>Break a bond</b>.  Make sure the molecule isn't claimed, and that
there are enough energy units in the Reaction Zone to break the bond.  
(If not, you can't break that bond this turn; try another bond or raise 
the temperature.) Move the bond and that number of energy units to the Bank.  

<li><b>Make a bond</b>.  Make sure that the atoms for both ends of 
the bond are in the Reaction Zone, and that enough space is available
in the shell to accomodate the bond.  Move the bond and its corresponding
energy from the Bank into the Reaction Zone, arranging the molecule to
accomodate its new bonding structure.

<li><b>Consume a Product</b>.  When one of your molecules matches
your face-up Product Card, you roll 3 colored dice; for each die,
if the value (V) shown is less than or equal to the corresponding number
in the fire diamond (D), remove V*D number of protective chits from that
section of their Lab.  If V > D, don't remove any chits.  After handling
the three effects, the molecule is dismantled to the bank.  The Product 
Card may be discarded or may stay, but you have to wait until next turn 
to claim another molecule.  

<li><b>Draw a Card</b>.  Move a Molecule Card from the Deck to your hand.
</ol>

<h4>End of Turn</h4>
The left-over energy in the Reaction Zone moves back to the 
Thermometer.

<h4>Game Ending</h4>
A player is out when she has lost all her protective chits in any one
of the 3 categories.

<h4>Determining the winner</h4>
The winner is the last chemist standing.
