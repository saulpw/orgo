first, create the four main organic atoms
carbon=C/black, 
oxygen=O/red, 
nitrogen=N/blue, 
hydrogen=H/small  

C/N/O should be around the size of a penny; H will be maybe half that diameter.

next create a circular "bonding shell" around C, N, O, such that the total
size of C > N > O >> H.

C has no chad, single bond is 90 degrees

N has a chad of 45 degrees, single bond is 105

O has a chad of 60 degrees, single bond of 150

[draw text carbon/nitrogen/oxygen on the C/N/O swaths, respectively, such
that when the pieces are put together, the words are clear, but when apart,
it is a puzzle.]

now with these raw pieces, we will make the most important bonds.

first, hydrogen single bond straight on 

C-H (4.11)
N-H (3.86)
O-H (4.59)

first, cyclohexane.  create a hexagon of carbon atoms, including
the chopped up bonding shells, such that the shells touch a bit.
rotate the carbon atoms such that the two C90s of each pair of carbons
are all that is connecting the circle.  take 2 C90s at that distance
and angle (120 degrees) and make a C-C bond (worth 3.46).

benzyl (???) by making a single bond on each C face out from center.
check for rotational symmetry and mirror symmetry. draw a hexagon and cut
out the inner circle

5-carbon ring to get C=C bond (6.02).

then replace top C with O to make ascorbate (vitamin c):

get C-O (3.58) bond angle/distance
get C=O (7.99) (straight on)
C-H (4.11)

hydrogen peroxide:
H-O (4.59)
O-O (1.42)

then create TNT
N-O (2.01) N105 and O120
N=O (6.07) N210 and O240
N~O (4.??) N105 and O240

N=N (4.18) two N210s
N-N (1.67) 
N-H (3.86)

C-N (3.05)
C=N (6.15)

--- bigger pieces

() means atoms are completely captured by the piece

C-(O)-C           : ether

Ethers feature C-O-C linkage defined by a bond angle of about 120° and C-O distances of about 1.5 Å. The barrier to rotation about the C-O bonds is low. The bonding of oxygen in ethers, alcohols, and water is similar. In the language of valence bond theory, the hybridization at oxygen is sp3.

Oxygen is more electronegative than carbon, thus the hydrogens alpha to ethers are more acidic than in simple hydrocarbons. They are far less acidic than hydrogens alpha to ketones, however.

(CH3)-C(H2)       : ethyl
C(H3)             : methyl
(OH)-C            : alcohol
(O)=C-(OH)        : carboxylic acid (COOH)
(O)=C-(H)         : aldehyde
(O)=C-(O)-C       : ester
(O)=(C)-C2        : ketone
(O)=C-(NH2)       : amide
C-(NH2)           : amine
(NH2)-C(H)-(COOH) : amino acid (amine + carboxylic acid + C-H)

In general, α-carbons of adjacent amino acids in a protein are about 3.8 ångströms (380 picometers) apart.

(O)=C             : carbonyl

package as:
  diethyl ether (ether + 2 ethyl)
  pyruvate (methyl + carboxylic acid + ketone)
  methanol     (alcohol + methyl)
  formaldehyde (aldehyde + C-H)
  carbon dioxide (2 x C=O)
  H2
  O2
