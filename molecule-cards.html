<h3>Reactants</h3>

<ol>

<li><b><span class="reactant">Oxygen (O2)</b></span>
<p><span class="flavor">Molecular oxygen accounts for 21% of Earth's
atmosphere.  Originally a toxic and corrosive waste product of early
bacterial life and archaea, modern aerobic life uses oxygen to dispose
of electrons stripped from its food, creating water.</span>
<span class="firediamond">(0,0,0,OX)</span>

<li><b><span class="reactant">Hydrogen gas (H2)</b></span>
<p><span class="flavor">Hydrogen contains more than twice as much
energy than gasoline by mass, and burns perfectly in oxygen, producing
only water.  However, hydrogen gas is virtually nonexistent on Earth,
only being created by humans as a byproduct of processing cheaper energy
compounds, like natural gas.</span>
<span class="firediamond">(0,4,0)</span>

<li><b><span class="reactant">Water (H2O)</b></span>
<p><span class="flavor">
Water is the only pure substance found naturally on Earth in solid, liquid, and
gas forms.  No other planet in our solar system has the requisite 
temperature and pressure for all three phases to exist simultaneously.

<span class="firediamond">(0,0,0)</span>

<li><b><span class="reactant">Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)</b></span>
<span class="firediamond">(3,0,1-4 depending on conc.)</span>

<li><b><span class="reactant">Carbon dioxide (CO2)</b></span>
<span class="firediamond">(2,0,0)</span>

<li><b><span class="reactant">Carbonic Acid</b></span>
<p><span class="flavor">

<li><b><span class="reactant">Formaldehyde (CH2O)</b></span>
<p><span class="flavor">

<span class="firediamond">(3,2,2)</span>

<li><b><span class="reactant">Methanol (CH3OH)</b></span>
<p><span class="flavor">

<span class="firediamond">(1,3,0)</span>

<li><b><span class="reactant">methane (CH4)</b></span>

<li><b><span class="reactant">ethylene</b></span>
<p><span class="flavor">
</span>
<span class="firediamond">(1,4,2)</span>

<li>
<b><span class="reactant">Ethyl alcohol (C2H7OH)</b></span>
<p><span class="flavor">Called ethyl alcohol in perfume, 
alcohol in vodka, and ethanol in fuel, this versatile solvent 
mixes with both water and oil products.
</span>
<span class="firediamond">(0,3,0)</span>


<li>
<b><span class="reactant">Acetic acid</b></span>
<p><span class="flavor">Acetic acid gives vinegar its sour taste and
very pungent smell when at high concentrations.  Nearly all forms of
life produce some amount of acetic acid.</span>
<span class="firediamond">(2,2,0)</span>

<li> <b><span class="reactant">Acetone (C3H6O)</b></span>

<p><span class="flavor">Acetone, a toxic and flammable solvent, evaporates 
quickly on contact with air, feeling cool when 
applied to skin.  Most people know acetone as the
active ingredient in nail polish remover, though
many industrial processes use it in the production 
of plastics and synthetic fibers.</span>

<li><b><span class="reactant">Propane (C3H8)</b></span>
<p><span class="flavor">"Taste the meat, not the heat." -- Hank Hill</span>
<span class="firediamond">(1,4,0)</span>

<p>
<li><b><span class="reactant">Glycerol (C3H8O3)</b></span>
<p><span class="flavor">

<li><b><span class="reactant">formic acid (HCOOH)</b></span>

<hr/>Nitrogen compounds

<li><span class="reactant"><b>urea ((NH2)2CO)</b></span>
<p><span class="flavor">
The human liver neutralizes ammonia, a toxic waste
product from the metabolism of nitrogren compounds,
into urea, which the body then excretes in sweat and
urine.  In 1828, Friedrich Woehler accidentally
synthesized urea from inanimate chemicals, proving
organic compounds did not require a biological "vital
force", thus launching the field of organic chemistry.
</span>
<span class="firediamond">(1,0,0)</span>

<li><span class="reactant"><b>glycine (C2H5NO2)</b></span>
<p><span class="flavor">
Glycine is the smallest and simplest of the 20 biologically important
amino acids that make proteins.  Most proteins contain very little
glycine, but more than 30% of the amino acids in the most abundant
protein in the human body, collagen, are glycine.
