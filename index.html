<h3>Background</h3>
<p>I became interested in Chemistry while reading 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0815332181/">Molecular Biology of the Cell</a>, and 
after much self-study, I realized that the general
mechanics of [organic] chemistry aren't that difficult.  While the 
names are long and technical, and proficiency requires memorization of
many specific reactions, most of our core understanding of
chemistry can be boiled down into a few fairly simple concepts:  the
twin conservations of matter and energy; the relationships between energy,
temperature, and entropy; and the formation and destruction of 
chemical bonds.  
<br>

<p>
These concepts are simple, but not straightforward.  I handily passed 
the Chemistry AP test in high-school, but I still had to double-check 
when I re-read that "breaking bonds takes energy, creating bonds makes 
energy".  I was not yet of drinking age when I first learned the formal 
definitions of alcohol, acid, and oxidation; it's much more interesting 
now to know that 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol">ethanol</a>,
in the presence of 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen">oxygen</a>,
degenerates to 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetic_acid">acetic acid</a>.
A bottle of wine left uncorked will be vinegar the next day!
<br>
<p>
I find these insights fascinating and grounding, not tedious and
theoretical as they are so often presented.  So for the past two years,
I've worked at communicating part of my grounded fascination to those 
who might be struggling with the subject.  What I came up with is <i>Orgo</i>, 
an organic chemistry board game.

<h3>What I've got so far</h3>

I spent a few hundred hours working on an interesting set of pieces
<a style="font-size: .6em" href="carboxyl-pieces.eps">(PS)</a> to model, on a flat surface,
the atoms and average bonds between them.  A good starting game can be 
made using only molecules with Carbon, Oxygen, and Hydrogen in them;
later expansions would continue with Nitrogen and then Sulfur and
maybe benzene rings or ionic bonds.  Each bond has its average enthalpy
value printed on it, converted to manageable game energy units.  A "star" in 
this version is the average ionization energy of one electron pair, so
you can tell at a glance how many electron pairs are in the bond.

I enumerated the set of <a href="molecule-cards.html">molecule cards</a>, 
for those simple molecules that can be represented with this set of pieces.  
Each molecule card notes the additional released bond energy in that
form in game energy units, as well as its toxicity/flammability/reactivity 
in the standard
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFPA_704">fire diamond</a>.  These
cards represent both the initial reactants and the ultimate arsenal
of poison, fire, and corrosion that each player unleashes on their opponent.  
Flavortext relates the molecule to everyday experience.

I drew up a 
<a href="orgo-board-2006.pdf">proper board</a>, though I must 
apologize for my meager design skills.  I wrote some 
<a href="rules.html">rules</a> that are playable but 
quite clunky.  

<b style="color: red;">This game is not finished yet.</b>  The rules need to be tested through 
with all manner of players and scenarios, and the specific numeric values 
on the cards and bonds need balancing, to be polite.
